        Input:
            matrix - of the matrix we are wanting to generate a Kirchhoff graph for
                    we should have put it in [IB] form and the matrix input should be
                    the B part with elements that are python Fractions

        During initiation of the class we generate the frame that will be used during
        the course of the algorithm.

        NOTES:
            (a) we determine the number of dimensions our frame will have
            (b) the number of vectors we will have is equal to the number of cross vectors
                (given by the dimensions of the frame) plus the number of cross vectors
                (given by the number of columns in our matrix)
            (c) we determine how closely the vertices in the frame will be to each other
                along each dimension. This gets saved in steps as the number of vertices
                in [0, 1) along that dimension. So if we have a distance of 1/2
                between vertices along dimension 0 then step[0] = 2.

            (e) we create a frame of the appropriate shape filled only with coordinate vectors
