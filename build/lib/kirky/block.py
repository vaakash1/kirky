        This method takes an edge (which is really just a head and tail position) and adds it
        into the frame by attaching it the vertices in the frame at the head and tail positions.
        If a vertex does not exist for either of those positions, it creates that vertex as
        well.

        IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD THE SAME EDGE TWICE. if you add the same edge twice you will
        have a problem as vertices can only have two of each kind of edge, one leaving and one
        entering the vertex. You cannot have two of the same leaving (weighting is handled by the
        edge itself).
